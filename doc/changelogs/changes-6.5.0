 - Class QHashSeed has been added.
 - [PYSIDE-510]  The non-standard __signature__ attribute of functions and
                 classes has been removed in favor of get_signature().

 - [PYSIDE-1713] A `signatures` attribute has been added to the Signal type
                 in order to increase compatibility with other

 - [PYSIDE-2029] __feature__ switching now works even with recursive imports
                 like in the qasync module. In addition, a new efficient
                 optimization has been implemented for __feature__ switching.

                 charts lightMarker and selection, charts selected point
                 configuration, graphgallery, qmlsurfacegallery,
                 map view (QtLocation) and and Qt Quick custom geometry
                 have been added.
 - [PYSIDE-971]  QOpenGLContext.getProcAddress() has been added.

                 improved.
 - [PYSIDE-1295] QObject::sender() has been implemented for non-C++ slots.
 - [PYSIDE-1345] QSGGeometry.vertexDataAsPoint2D()/setVertexDataAsPoint2D()
                 has been added.
 - [PYSIDE-1564] Cooperative multiple inheritance is now implemented for all
                 __init__ methods.
 - [PYSIDE-1603] Signals are now listed in the typing hints.
 - [PYSIDE-1612] Initial support for Android Deployment has been added.
 - [PYSIDE-1713] Compatibility of Qt signals has been improved
                 by providing a signatures attribute.
 - [PYSIDE-1735] Documentation: enum types are now indicated.
 - [PYSIDE-2079] setuptools are now used instead of distutils.
 - [PYSIDE-2098] dicts can now be passed as QVariantMap to QML.
 - [PYSIDE-2136] An error calling deprecated functions with
                 warning-as-error set has been fixed.
 - [PYSIDE-2141] A crash when deleting QObject instances with connections
                 in threads has been fixed.
 - [PYSIDE-2155] CMake UNITY_BUILD (jumbo) builds are now supported, speeding
                 up building. Pass --unity to setup.py.
 - [PYSIDE-2160] The formatting of delayed errors in Python 3.11

****************************************************************************

 - shiboken6 now generates new calls to the new functions PyObject_Vectorcall()
   or PyObject_CallNoArgs() for overridden virtual methods for newer Python
   versions (not for Limited API).
 - shiboken6 can now generate exclusions for classes based on preprocessor
   conditions, for example by the Qt configure system.
 - [PYSIDE-454]  It is now possible to specify names and namespaces for smart
                 pointer instantiations.
 - [PYSIDE-1019] Documentation for Qt properties is now generated.
 - [PYSIDE-1106] Documentation for Qt signals is now generated.
 - [PYSIDE-1106] shiboken6/Documentation: Use the py:method directives
 - [PYSIDE-2088] An overflow of 64bit enumerations has been fixed.
 - [PYSIDE-2099] An option --lean-header to generate forward declarations
                 instead of includes into the module header has been added.
                 This considerably reduces the dependencies but may require
                 additional includes to be specified for injected code.
 - [PYSIDE-2133] The sorting of overloads for integer/float types has been
                 improved to avoid overflows.
 - [PYSIDE-2256] The code generator no longer generates goto's.
 - [PYSIDE-2174] A typesystem XML element for opaque containers has been
                 added, removing the need repeat the container element.
 - [PYSIDE-2174] Support for std::array (C++ 11) and std::span has been added.
 - [PYSIDE-2255] Overriding abstract private virtual methods is now possible.
 - [PYSIDE-2264] A PyPy problem with version 7.3.10 and up was fixed.
