Qt for Python 6.0.0 is a new major version release. It is not compatible with
earlier Qt for Python releases.

The goal has been to retain as much source compatibility with
Qt for Python Qt 5.15 as possible, but some changes were inevitable.

To make it easier to port to Qt for Python 6.0.0, we have created a porting
guide to summarize those changes and provide guidance to handle them. In
the guide, you can find links to articles about changes that may affect
your application and help you transition from Qt for Python 5.15 to
Qt for Python 6.0.0:
