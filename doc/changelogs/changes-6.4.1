                 instead of includes into the module header has been added.

                 has been fixed.

 - [PYSIDE-1844] Build system: On Windows, shiboken is now executed by a
                 wrapper providing the appropriate PATH containing Qt and
                 libclang, removing the need to set the PATH.
 - [PYSIDE-2088] A way of specifying types for casting enum values has been
                 added, fixing an overflow occurring for
