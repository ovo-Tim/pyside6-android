# PySide6 Essentials

PySide6 is the official Python module from the
[Qt for Python project](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python),
which provides access to the complete Qt 6.0+ framework.

The Qt for Python project is developed in the open, with all facilities you'd expect
from any modern OSS project such as all code in a git repository and an open
design process. We welcome any contribution conforming to the
[Qt Contribution Agreement](https://www.qt.io/contributionagreement/).

This is a minimal wheel for [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6),
it includes only the essentials Qt modules:

* QtCore
* QtGui
* QtWidgets
* QtHelp
* QtNetwork
* QtConcurrent
* QtDBus
* QtDesigner
* QtOpenGL
* QtOpenGLWidgets
* QtPrintSupport
* QtQml
* QtQuick
* QtQuickControls2
* QtQuickWidgets
* QtXml
* QtTest
* QtSql
* QtSvg
* QtSvgWidgets
* QtUiTools

### Licensing

PySide6 is available under both Open Source (LGPLv3/GPLv2) and commercial
license.  Using PyPi is the recommended installation source, because the
content of the wheels is valid for both cases.  For more information, refer to
the [Qt Licensing page](https://www.qt.io/licensing/).
