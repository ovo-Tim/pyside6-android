Character Map Example
=====================

The example displays an array of characters which the user can click on
to enter text in a line edit. The contents of the line edit can then be
copied into the clipboard, and pasted into other applications. The
purpose behind this sort of tool is to allow users to enter characters
that may be unavailable or difficult to locate on their keyboards.
