Using a Simple Button
=====================

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to handle **signals and slots**
using Qt for Python. **Signals and slots** is a Qt feature that lets
your graphical widgets communicate with other graphical widgets or
your python code. Our application creates a button that logs the
`Button clicked, Hello!` message to the python console each time you
click it.

Let's start by importing the necessary PySide6 classes and python
`sys` module:
::

    import sys
    from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QPushButton
    from PySide6.QtCore import Slot

Let's also create a python function that logs the message to the
console:
::

    # Greetings
    @Slot()
    def say_hello():
        print("Button clicked, Hello!")

.. note:: The `@Slot()` is a decorator that identifies a function as
    a slot. It is not important to understand why for now,
    but use it always to avoid unexpected behavior.

Now, as mentioned in previous examples you must create the
`QApplication` to run your PySide6 code:
::

    # Create the Qt Application
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)

Let's create the clickable button, which is a `QPushButton` instance.
To label the button, we pass a python string to the constructor:
::

    # Create a button
    button = QPushButton("Click me")

Before we show the button, we must connect it to the `say_hello()`
function that we defined earlier. There are two ways of doing this;
using the old style or the new style, which is more pythonic. Let's
use the new style in this case. You can find more information about
both these styles in the
`Signals and Slots in PySide6 <https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python_Signals_and_Slots>`_
wiki page.

The `QPushButton` has a predefined signal called **clicked**, which
is triggered every time the button is clicked. We'll connect this
signal to the `say_hello()` function:
::

    # Connect the button to the function
    button.clicked.connect(say_hello)

Finally, we show the button and start the Qt main loop:
::

    # Show the button
    button.show()
    # Run the main Qt loop
    app.exec()

Here is the complete code for this example:
::

    #!/usr/bin/python

    import sys
    from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QPushButton
    from PySide6.QtCore import Slot

    @Slot()
    def say_hello():
     print("Button clicked, Hello!")

    # Create the Qt Application
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    # Create a button, connect it and show it
    button = QPushButton("Click me")
    button.clicked.connect(say_hello)
    button.show()
    # Run the main Qt loop
    app.exec()

After a few clicks, you will get something like this on your terminal:
