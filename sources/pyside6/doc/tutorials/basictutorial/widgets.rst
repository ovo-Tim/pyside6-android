Your First QtWidgets Application
*********************************

As with any other programming framework,
you start with the traditional "Hello World" program.

Here is a simple example of a Hello World application in PySide6:

.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    from PySide6.QtWidgets import QApplication, QLabel

    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    label = QLabel("Hello World!")
    label.show()
    app.exec()


When you execute it the code, the application will look like:

.. image:: widgets.png
   :alt: Simple Widget


For a widget application using PySide6, you must always start by
importing the appropriate class from the `PySide6.QtWidgets` module.

After the imports, you create a `QApplication` instance. As Qt can
receive arguments from command line, you may pass any argument to
the QApplication object. Usually, you don't need to pass any
arguments so you can leave it as is, or use the following approach:

.. code-block:: python

    app = QApplication([])

After the creation of the application object, we have created a
`QLabel` object. A `QLabel` is a widget that can present text
(simple or rich, like html), and images:

.. code-block:: python

    # This HTML approach will be valid too!
    label = QLabel("<font color=red size=40>Hello World!</font>")

.. note:: After creating the label, we call `show()` on it.

Finally, we call `app.exec()` to enter the Qt main loop and start
to execute the Qt code. In reality, it is only here where the label
is shown, but this can be ignored for now.
