Chapter 6 - Plot the data in the ChartView
===========================================

The last step of this tutorial is to plot the CSV data inside our QChart. For
this, you need to go over our data and include the data on a QLineSeries.

After adding the data to the series, you can modify the axis to properly
display the QDateTime on the X-axis, and the magnitude values on the Y-axis.

Here is the updated :code:`main_widget.py` that includes an additional
function to plot data using a QLineSeries:

.. literalinclude:: datavisualize6/main_widget.py
   :language: python
   :linenos:
   :lines: 3-
   :emphasize-lines: 33,56-91

Now, run the application to visualize the earthquake magnitudes
data at different times.

Try modifying the sources to get different output. For example, you could try
to plot more data from the CSV.
