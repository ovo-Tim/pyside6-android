To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the following directive:

::

    import PySide6.QtTest

.. note:: Not all macros in the C++ version of QtTest were exposed in PySide. This module is useful only for GUI testing and benchmarking; for ordinary unit testing you should use the ``pytest`` Python module.
