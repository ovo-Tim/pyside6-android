The Qt OpenGL provides the OpenGL widget class that can be used just like any
other Qt widget, except that it opens an OpenGL display buffer where you can
use the OpenGL API to render the contents. To include the definitions of
the module's classes, use the following directive:

::

    import PySide6.QtOpenGLWidgets
