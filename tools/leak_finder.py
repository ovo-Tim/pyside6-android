leak_finder.py
==============

This script finds memory leaks in Python.

Usage:
------

Place one or more lines which should be tested for leaks in a loop:

    from leak_finder import LeakFinder
    ...
    lf = LeakFinder()
    for i in range(1000):
        leaking_statement()
    lf.find_leak()


Theory
------

How to find a leak?

We repeatedly perform an action and observe if that has an unexpected
side effect. There are typically two observations:

* one object is growing its refcount (a pseudo-leak)
* we get many new objects of one type (a true leak)

A difficulty in trying to get leak info is avoiding side effects
of the measurement. Early attempts with lists of refcounts were
unsuccessful. Using array.array for counting refcounts avoids that.


Algorithm
---------
We record a snapshot of all objects in a list and a parallel array
of refcounts.

Then we do some computation and do the same snapshot again.

The structure of a list of all objects is extending at the front for
some reason. That makes the captured structures easy to compare.
We reverse that list and array and have for the objects:

    len(all2) >= len(all1)

    all1[idx] == all2[idx] for idx in range(len(all1))

When taking the second snapshot, the objects still have references from
the first snapshot.
For objects with no effect, the following relation is true:

    refs1[idx] == refs2[idx] - 1 for idx in range(len(all1))

All other objects are potential pseudo-leaks, because they waste
references but no objects in the first place.

Then we look at the newly created objects:
These objects are real leaks if their number is growing with the probe
size. For analysis, the number of new objects per type is counted.
